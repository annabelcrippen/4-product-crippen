                        <p>A lot of the time, consumers will not have the ability to cook their own meals and even feeding themselves can be a challenge. Depending on the consumer, a PCA may need to cook meals and help them to use utensils. Again, the tastes of the client and how often they eat are to be respected and PCA's should only make meals when they are asked for.</p>

                        <p>A primary job of a PCA is making sure the client has help with their hygiene habits such as brushing teeth, bathing and using products like deodorant and after shave. The ability to do these tasks is often hindered by their disability but the degreee of help they want is unique to the consumer. The most important aspect of hygiene is that you respect the clients needs and wishes for how they want the task done and how often they practise the habits. </p>

                        <p>Errands are a key part of a PCA's role because often the consumer has no ability to leave the house and do daily tasks. Often, a PCA will be called upon to drive the consumer to places like the grocery store or the bank and help them to fulfill their errands. PCA's petrol money is not included in the base pay so please negotiate with your consumer if the issue arises.</p>

                        <p>Chores will often include: vacuuming, cleaning windows, tidying and laundry. The consumer often has no ability to do these things on their own which is where the PCA steps in to help with the processes. Respect and listening is key for these tasks because often the consumer will have specific ways they want things to look.</p>

                        <h2>Mental Disabilities</h2>
                        <p>Mental disabilities can be to a varying degree based on what part of the brain is effected in the client. Often the client will have deficients of IQ or certain reasoning skills. A PCA will get all information on a clients conditions when they sign on to the job.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="Physical disabilities" class="tab" style="display:none">
                        <h2>Physical Disabilities</h2>
                        <p>Physical disabilities prevent your client from doing normal tasks and can be very frustrating. Conditions such as cerebral palsy or seizure disorder can make a client feel trapped while they are trying to live a normal life which isds where a PCA steps in to make them feel like they can live a normal life.</p> 
                    </div>
                    
                    <div id="Questions and Answers" class="tab" style="display:none">
                        <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
                        <p>Will I get to negotiate with my consumer on which tasks I am asked to do? 
                           This depends on the consumer and their disabilities. As a PCA, your job is never firmly laid out because needs vary between consumers, if your consumer has a need for a task it is not optional whether you do it.
                           
                           What are the hours? 
                           Hours also vary between consumer. The state gives a certain amount of PCA hours to the consumer in which the PCA can then work all of them or split them between another PCA.
